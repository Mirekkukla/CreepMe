CreepMe to-do list
=======

- Make custom adapter to show phone number in autocomplete 
listview element, as well as name. Right now the stock ArrayAdapter<String> 
can only fill the top textview and every time I get the bottom 
one to fill, the autocomplete stops working.

- get profile pic from contact

- add circular crop to profile pictures

- Rearrange items in a listview by drag and drop

- Build Settings page
